Some time in the summer of 2019, I started to have a desire to learn how do to something new. 
I have been a professional writer for the past ten years, and in the last two years I started blogging about fundraising, which is my profession. 
After using Wordpress for two and a half years, I began to see the limitations of using a tool without understanding it. 

I needed to learn how to code. I had to get into the guts of how web development worked, or I'd never be able to put up the kind of site that I had in my imagination.

This started my quest to learn coding.
